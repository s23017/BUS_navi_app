# Gacha Assets

Put your gacha character PNG files inside the `characters/` directory. Make sure the file names match the paths referenced in `src/app/gacha/page.tsx`:

- `dora.png`
- `dog.png`
- `frog.png`
- `gost.png`
- `mogu.png`
- `rabi.png`

You can replace these PNGs with your own artwork as long as you keep the same file names (or update the paths in the component).
